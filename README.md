## Installation
Git clone the repository, import project in Android Studio, and run on an android device.

## Architecture Overview
This application makes use of the MVVM architectural pattern. 
Our project follows: Activity -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Remote Data Source -> Retrofit -> Webservice.
LiveData is retrieved from the Remote Data Source into our repository, then it trickles down all the way to our ViewModel. The activities do not hold data.

TO DO: Adding a local database cache using Room Persistence Library.

## External Dependencies

- [Recipes API](https://recipesapi.herokuapp.com/api/search): This is our core API, used to retrieve all the information about recipes.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): Used to setup a REST API.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): Library to display our recipe/food images.
- [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView): Library used to make circular image views.
